- Fact 1: I play online chess amlost every day. The site I play on, lichess.org, records game and rating statistics. 

- Fact 2: Chess performance is closely tied to cognitive capabilities. These cognitive capabilities are definitely modulated by fatigue, and probably modulated by emotional states.

- Fact 3: I fill out a daily survey (I designed it myself) that measures, among other things, how stressed I am, how happy I am, and how much sleep I got the previous night.

This combination of facts makes for some interesting possibilities for insight into the relationships between my cognitive and emotional states. In this directory I plan to put some scripts for extracting and organizing chess statistics, and some long-form exploratory data analysis about interesting questions.
