# chess_brain: Online Chess and Cognitive Performance

The tragedy of an undergraduate psychology degree: I sit in lecture after lecture, learning about human mind/brain/behavior. It's all fascinating of course, but I didn't come here to learn about human mind/brain/behavior. I came here to learn about _my_ mind/brain/behavior. Or at least those of people I interact with. Unfortunately, interesting psychology research tends to be conducted in laboratories with trained researchers. Even after the research stage, good psychometric evaluations are preformed by good clinicians in controlled environments. I don't have access to those things at this stage of my life. 

Like, for example, I've read lots of interesting papers about sleep and circadian rhythms, but have no more than anecdotal evidence about my own cognitive performance throughout the day, or the amount of sleep I really need per night.

It felt silly to do so much learning about quantified psychology without even trying to quantify my own psychology, so I made myself a daily survey. I kept it short--no room for multi-item measures--but it has questions for measuring how stressed I am, how happy I am, and how much sleep I got the previous night, among other things. At this point I've been filling it out for a few months.

This is, of course, terrible science. The samples are non-independent, I'm biased in my answers by whatever hypotheses I might be thinking about, and I'm not even consistent about the time of exact time of day at which I take the survey. My stress and mood obviously fluctuate a lot throughout the day. I try to think through the whole day when I fill out the survey, but the measures are rough at best.

One thing my survey doesn't measure is cognitive performance. I don't even ask myself how tired I'm feeling. I don't ask about this because I think I have a better way to measure it: Chess.

## Is Online Chess a Good Psychometric Tool?

I play online chess almost every day. The site I play on, lichess.org, automatically records game and rating statistics. Chess performance is closely tied to cognitive capabilities. These cognitive capabilities are definitely modulated by fatigue, and probably modulated by emotional states.
